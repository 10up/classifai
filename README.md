## Pricing

Note that there is no cost to using ClassifAI itself. Both IBM Watson and Microsoft Azure have free plans for some of their AI services, but above those free plans there are paid levels as well.  So if you expect to process a high volume of content, then you'll want to review the pricing plans for these services to understand if you'll incur any costs.  For the most part, both services' free plans are quite generous and should at least allow for testing ClassifAI to better understand its featureset and could at best allow for totally free usage. OpenAI has a limited trial option that can be used for testing but will require a valid paid plan after that.

IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding ("NLU"), which is one of the providers that powers the classification feature, has a ["lite" pricing tier](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-natural-language-understanding/pricing) that offers 30,000 free NLU items per month.

OpenAI, which is one of the providers that powers the classification, title generation, excerpt generation, content resizing, audio transcripts generation, text to speech, moderation and image generation features, has a limited free trial and then requires a [pay per usage](https://openai.com/pricing) plan.

Microsoft Azure AI Vision, which is one of the providers that powers the descriptive text generator, image tags generator, image cropping, image text extraction and PDF text extraction features, has a ["free" pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) that offers 20 transactions per minute and 5,000 transactions per month.

Microsoft Azure AI Speech, which is one of the providers that powers the text to speech feature, has a ["free" pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/) that offers 0.5 million characters per month.

## Set Up the Smart 404 Feature

### 1. Decide on Provider

* This Feature is powered by either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.
* Once you've chosen a Provider, you'll need to create an account and get authentication details.
  * When setting things up on the Azure side, ensure you choose either the `text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-3-large` model. The Feature will not work with other models.

### 2. Configure Settings under Tools > ClassifAI > Language Processing > Smart 404

* Select the proper Provider in the provider dropdown.
* Enter your authentication details.
* Configure any other settings as desired.

### 3. ElasticPress configuration

Once the Smart 404 Feature is configured, you can then proceed to get ElasticPress set up to index the data.

If on a standard WordPress installation:

* Install and activate the [ElasticPress](https://github.com/10up/elasticpress) plugin.
* Set your Elasticsearch URL in the ElasticPress settings (`ElasticPress > Settings`).
* Go to the `ElasticPress > Sync` settings page and trigger a sync, ensuring this is set to run a sync from scratch. This will send over the new schema to Elasticsearch and index all content, including creating vector embeddings for each post.

If on a WordPress VIP hosted environment:

* [Enable Enterprise Search](https://docs.wpvip.com/enterprise-search/enable/)
* [Run the VIP-CLI `index` command](https://docs.wpvip.com/enterprise-search/index/). This sends the new schema to Elasticsearch and indexes all content, including creating vector embeddings for each post. Note you may need to use the `--setup` flag to ensure the schema is created correctly.

At this point all of your content should be indexed, along with the embeddings data. You'll then need to update your 404 template to display the recommended results.

### 4. Display the recommended results

The Smart 404 Feature comes with a few helper functions that can be used to display the recommended results on your 404 page:

* Directly display the results using the `Classifai\render_smart_404_results()` function.
* Get the data and then display it in your own way using the `Classifai\get_smart_404_results()` function.

You will need to directly integrate these functions into your 404 template where desired. The plugin does not automatically display the results on the 404 page for you.

Both functions support the following arguments. If any argument is not provided, the default value set on the settings page will be used:

* `$index` (string) - The ElasticPress index to search in. Default is `post`.
* `$num` (int) - Maximum number of results to display. Default is `5`.
* `$num_candidates` (int) - Maximum number of results to search over. Default is `5000`.
* `$rescore` (bool) - Whether to run a rescore query or not. Can give better results but often is slower. Default is `false`.
* `$score_function` (string) - The [vector scoring function](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-script-score-query.html#vector-functions) to use. Default is `cosine`. Options are `cosine`, `dot_product`, `l1_norm` and `l2_norm`.

The `Classifai\render_smart_404_results()` function also supports the following additional arguments:

* `$fallback` (bool) - Whether to run a fallback WordPress query if no results are found in Elasticsearch. These results will then be rendered. Default is `true`.

Examples:

```php
// Render the results.
Classifai\render_smart_404_results(
  [
    'index'          => 'post',
    'num'            => 3,
    'num_candidates' => 1000,
    'rescore'        => true,
    'fallback'       => true,
    'score_function' => 'dot_product',
  ]
);
```

```php
// Get the results.
$results = Classifai\get_smart_404_results(
  [
    'index'          => 'post',
    'num'            => 10,
    'num_candidates' => 8000,
    'rescore'        => false,
    'score_function' => 'cosine',
  ]
);

ob_start();

// Render the results.
foreach ( $results as $result ) {
?>
  <div>
    <?php if ( has_post_thumbnail( $result->ID ) ) : ?>
      <figure>
        <a href="<?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $result->ID ) ); ?>">
          <?php echo wp_kses_post( get_the_post_thumbnail( $result->ID ) ); ?>
        </a>
      </figure>
    <?php endif; ?>
    <a href="<?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $result->ID ) ); ?>">
      <?php echo esc_html( $result->post_title ); ?>
    </a>
  </div>
<?php
}

$output = ob_get_clean();
echo $output;
```

### Local Quickstart

If you want to quickly test things locally, ensure you have Docker installed (Docker Desktop recommended) and then run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 9200:9200 -d --name elasticsearch \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
  -e "xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled=false" \
  -e "xpack.license.self_generated.type=basic" \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.9.0
```

This will download, install and start Elasticsearch v7.9.0 to your local machine. You can then access Elasticsearch at `http://localhost:9200`, which is the same URL you can use to configure ElasticPress with. It is recommended that you change the `Content Items per Index Cycle` setting in ElasticPress to `20` to ensure indexing doesn't timeout. Also be aware of API rate limits on the OpenAI Embeddings API.

## Set Up the Term Cleanup Feature

### 1. Decide on Provider

* This Feature is powered by either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.
* Once you've chosen a Provider, you'll need to create an account and get authentication details.
  * When setting things up on the Azure side, ensure you choose either the `text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-3-large` model. The Feature will not work with other models.

### 2. Configure Settings under Tools > ClassifAI > Language Processing > Term Cleanup

* Select the proper Provider in the provider dropdown.
* Enter your authentication details.
* Configure any other settings as desired.

### 3. ElasticPress configuration

It is recommended to use ElasticPress with this Feature, especially if processing more than 500 terms, as performance will be significantly better. Once the Term Cleanup Feature is configured, you can then proceed to get ElasticPress set up to index the data.

If on a standard WordPress installation:

* Install and activate the [ElasticPress](https://github.com/10up/elasticpress) plugin.
* Set your Elasticsearch URL in the ElasticPress settings (`ElasticPress > Settings`).
* Enable the [term index](https://www.elasticpress.io/blog/2023/03/enabling-comments-and-terms-in-elasticpress-5-0/) feature.
* Go to the `ElasticPress > Sync` settings page and trigger a sync, ensuring this is set to run a sync from scratch. This will send over the new schema to Elasticsearch and index all content, including creating vector embeddings for each term.

If on a WordPress VIP hosted environment:

* [Enable Enterprise Search](https://docs.wpvip.com/enterprise-search/enable/).
* [Enable the term index](https://docs.wpvip.com/enterprise-search/enable-features/#h-terms). Example command: `vip @example-app.develop -- wp vip-search activate-feature terms`.
* [Run the VIP-CLI `index` command](https://docs.wpvip.com/enterprise-search/index/). This sends the new schema to Elasticsearch and indexes all content, including creating vector embeddings for each term. Note you may need to use the `--setup` flag to ensure the schema is created correctly.

### 4. Start the Term Cleanup Process

Once configured, the plugin will add a new submenu under the Tools menu called Term Cleanup.

* Go to the Term Cleanup page, click on your desired taxonomy, then click on the "Find similar" button.
* This initializes a background process that will compare each term to find ones that are similar.
* Once done, all the results will be displayed.
* You can then skip or merge the potential duplicate terms from the settings page.

## Set Up Image Processing features (via Microsoft Azure)

## Set Up Recommended Content (via Microsoft Azure AI Personalizer)

Azure AI Personalizer has been retired by Microsoft [as of September 2023](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/personalizer/). The service will continue to work until 2026 but Personalizer resources can no longer be created. As such, consider this provider deprecated and be aware that we will be removing this in the near future. We are hoping to replace with a new provider to maintain the same functionality (see [issue#392](https://github.com/10up/classifai/issues/392)).

Note that [Personalizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/personalizer/) requires sufficient data volume to enable Personalizer to learn. In general, we recommend a minimum of ~1,000 events per day to ensure Personalizer learns effectively. If Personalizer doesn't receive sufficient data, the service takes longer to determine the best actions.

### 1. Sign up for Azure services

- [Register for a Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or sign into your existing one.
- Log into your account and create a new [Personalizer resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesPersonalizer).
- Enter your service name, select a subscription, location, pricing tier, and resource group.
- Select **Create** to create the resource.
- After your resource has deployed, select the **Go to Resource** button to go to your Personalizer resource.
- Click `Keys and Endpoint` in the left hand Resource Management menu to view the `Endpoint` URL for this resource.
- Click the copy icon next to `KEY 1` to copy the API Key credential for this resource.

For more information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/personalizer/how-to-create-resource

### 2. Configure Microsoft Azure API and Key under Tools > ClassifAI > Recommended Content

- In the `Endpoint URL` field, enter your `Endpoint` URL from Step 1 above.
- In the `API Key` field, enter your `KEY 1` from Step 1 above.

### 3. Use "Recommended Content" block to display recommended content on your website

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What data does ClassifAI gather?

ClassifAI connects your WordPress site directly to your account with specific service provider(s) (e.g. Microsoft Azure AI, IBM Watson, OpenAI), so no data is gathered by 10up.  The data gathered in our [registration form](https://classifaiplugin.com/#cta) is used simply to stay in touch with users so we can provide product updates and news.  More information is available in the [Privacy Policy on ClassifAIplugin.com](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Hn4XEWmNGqeMzLqnS7Uru2Hl2vJeLc7cI7225ztThgQ).

### What are the Categories, Keywords, Concepts, and Entities within the NLU Language Processing feature?

[Categories](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-about#categories) are five levels of hierarchies that IBM Watson can identify from your text.  [Keywords](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-about#keywords) are specific terms from your text that IBM Watson is able to identify.  [Concepts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-about#concepts) are high-level concepts that are not necessarily directly referenced in your text.  [Entities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-about#entities) are people, companies, locations, and classifications that are made by IBM Watson from your text.

### How can I view the taxonomies that are generated from the NLU classification?

Whatever options you have selected in the Category, Keyword, Entity, and Concept taxonomy dropdowns in the NLU classification settings can be viewed within Classic Editor metaboxes and the Block Editor side panel.  They can also be viewed in the All Posts and All Pages table list views by utilizing the Screen Options to enable those columns if they're not already appearing in your table list view.

### Should I alert my site's users that AI tools are being used?

We recommend that you are transparent with your users that AI tools are being used.  This can be done by adding a notice to your site's Privacy Policy or similar page. Sample copy is provided below:

> This site makes use of Artificial Intelligence tools to help with tasks like language processing, image processing, and content recommendations.

### When a post is sent to OpenAI (e.g. to generate a title or excerpt), is the post content fed into OpenAI and used for other customers?

According to OpenAI, they do not train their models on any data that is sent via API requests (see https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy). OpenAI may keep the data for up to 30 days to identify abuse, though you can request zero data retention (ZDR) with a qualifying use-case.

## Support Level

**Active:** 10up is actively working on this, and we expect to continue work for the foreseeable future including keeping tested up to the most recent version of WordPress.  Bug reports, feature requests, questions, and pull requests are welcome.
