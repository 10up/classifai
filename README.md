## Pricing

Note that there is no cost to using ClassifAI itself. Both IBM Watson and Microsoft Azure have free plans for their AI services, but above those free plans there are paid levels as well.  So if you expect to process a high volume of content, then you'll want to review the pricing plans for these services to understand if you'll incur any costs.  For the most part, both services' free plans are quite generous and should at least allow for testing ClassifAI to better understand its featureset and could at best allow for totally free usage. OpenAI has a limited trial option that can be used for testing but will require a valid paid plan after that.

The service that powers ClassifAI's NLU Language Processing, IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding ("NLU"), has a ["lite" pricing tier](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-natural-language-understanding/pricing) that offers 30,000 free NLU items per month.

The service that powers ClassifAI's ChatGPT, Embeddings and Whisper Language Processing and DALL·E Image Processing, OpenAI, has a limited free trial and then requires a [pay per usage](https://openai.com/pricing) plan.

The service that powers ClassifAI's Azure AI Vision Image Processing, Microsoft Azure, has a ["free" pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) that offers 20 transactions per minute and 5,000 transactions per month.

The service that powers ClassifAI's Text to Speech Language Processing, Microsoft Azure, has a ["free" pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/) that offers 0.5 million characters per month.

The service that powers ClassifAI's Recommended Content, Microsoft Azure AI Personalizer, has a ["free" pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/personalizer/) that offers 50,000 transactions per month.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What data does ClassifAI gather?

ClassifAI connects your WordPress site directly to your account with specific service provider(s) (e.g. Microsoft Azure AI, IBM Watson, OpenAI), so no data is gathered by 10up.  The data gathered in our [registration form](https://classifaiplugin.com/#cta) is used simply to stay in touch with users so we can provide product updates and news.  More information is available in the [Privacy Policy on ClassifAIplugin.com](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Hn4XEWmNGqeMzLqnS7Uru2Hl2vJeLc7cI7225ztThgQ).

### What are the Categories, Keywords, Concepts, and Entities within the NLU Language Processing feature?

[Categories](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-about#categories) are five levels of hierarchies that IBM Watson can identify from your text.  [Keywords](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-about#keywords) are specific terms from your text that IBM Watson is able to identify.  [Concepts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-about#concepts) are high-level concepts that are not necessarily directly referenced in your text.  [Entities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/natural-language-understanding?topic=natural-language-understanding-about#entities) are people, companies, locations, and classifications that are made by IBM Watson from your text.

### How can I view the taxonomies that are generated from the NLU Language Processing?

Whatever options you have selected in the Category, Keyword, Entity, and Concept taxonomy dropdowns in the NLU Language Processing settings can be viewed within Classic Editor metaboxes and the Block Editor side panel.  They can also be viewed in the All Posts and All Pages table list views by utilizing the Screen Options to enable those columns if they're not already appearing in your table list view.

### Should I alert my site's users that AI tools are being used?

We recommend that you are transparent with your users that AI tools are being used.  This can be done by adding a notice to your site's Privacy Policy or similar page. Sample copy is provided below:

> This site makes use of Artificial Intelligence tools to help with tasks like language processing, image processing, and content recommendations.
